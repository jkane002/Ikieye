  <h3 align="center">IkiEye</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Struggling to find a passion? Are you disliking your job? Wondering if there's a job for you? IkiEye ('i•kee•ai) has the answers. IkiEye derives from the Japanese concept ikigai ('i•kee•guy) that means "a reason for being". Sit down and ask yourself these questions:
    <ol>
      <li>What are things you love to do? Think back to your childhood. What made you feel like you're on top of the world? Where do you find yourself happy? List it out.
      </li>
      <li>What are you good at? A good communicator? Coding? Sports? Teaching? Listening? An activist? Find things that make you shine. Write those down.
      </li>
      <li>What does the world need? As a divided nation, what can bring us together? Love? Teaching? More communication devices? Accessibility? List them.
      </li>
      <li>Lastly, what jobs are out there? The job market is always fluctuating. Find what is trending. Artists? Engineers? Teachers? Entrepreneurs?
      </li>
    </ol> 
    IkiEye helps you find a connection among all these questions. Give it a try!
